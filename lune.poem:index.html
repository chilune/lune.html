<p> The moon shall be set; and the soft veil, <br>
  This bark of midnight shades and shrinking eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This poem uses metaphors to create a beautiful, slightly ominous and mysterious atmosphere. It compares the sky to midnight shades, and stars to shrinking eyes -- making readers think deeply and delve into the meaning of the poem. It is a more simple, short, minimalistic poem, but the scarce usage of words makes it all the more sophisticated.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> MY EDITS/ADDITIONS:</p>
<p>Luminescent feathers turn silver to gold, <br>
  Blinking fireflies give way to shape-shifters. <br>
  They cast their shrouds; sheathing secret flames, <br>
  Ever-changing as day becomes night, and night becomes day.&nbsp;</p>
